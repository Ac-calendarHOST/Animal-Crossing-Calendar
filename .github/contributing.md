Anyone Is allowed to submit changes/fixes to the files.
Every submission big and small will be reviewed by me to confirm that there hasn't been any changes to other files that haven't been noted in the submission details.
Once your submitted changes have been accepted they will be used at our website www.ac-calendar.com, without crediting you.
There are exceptions, like when you've single-handedly localized a file to your own language like Japanese you'll get the full credits.
