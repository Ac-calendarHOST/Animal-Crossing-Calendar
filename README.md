# AnimalCrossingCalendar
(NOT UP-TO-DATE I'VE CHANGED STUFF INSIDE THE CALENDAR AFTER STARTING THE GITHUB PAGE. AFTER THAT IT WILL GO PUBLICALLY)
This is the repository containing all the calendar files of The Animal Crossing Calendar Project!

I made this open-source because of the general positivity inside the Animal Crossing community, and everyone is free to use the .ics files privately and publically as long as you'll link to the original website(www.ac-calendar.com) or link to the GitHub page.

Any changes to the GitHub page will be validated by me and will be uploaded to the calendar host.
