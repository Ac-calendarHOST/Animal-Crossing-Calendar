# Animal Crossing Calendar

This is the repository containing all the calendar files of The Animal Crossing Calendar Project!

I made this open-source because of the general positivity inside the Animal Crossing community, and everyone is free to use the .ics files privately and publically Without the requirement of crediting nor linking to the GitHub page/the ac-calendar.com website. (Of course if you actually do link back to the project it's greatly appreciated.)

Any submitted changes to the GitHub page will be validated by me and after that it will be uploaded to the calendar host for use on the website.
